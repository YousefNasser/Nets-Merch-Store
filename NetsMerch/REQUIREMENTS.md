      * Hint: In the Shoe List destination, to add a child view programmatically to a ViewGroup, such as LinearLayout, 
      use the addView() method. Refer to a sample implementation in the StackOverflow discussion [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2395769/how-to-programmatically-add-views-to-views).

15. Make sure you canâ€™t go back to onboarding screens
    * Use an Activity level ViewModel to hold a list of Shoes (use by activityViewModels)
    * Observe the shoes variable from the ViewModel
    * Add a new layout item into the scrollview for each shoe.

## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!

1. The student uses styling on the TextViews and buttons 

2. Layouts look nicer than the basic layout 

3. Navigation uses Capitalized names for the labels 

4. Navigation uses enter/exit animations
